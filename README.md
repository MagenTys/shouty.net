# Shouty

Shouty is a social networking application for short physical distances.
When someone shouts, only people within 100m can hear it.

Shouty doesn't exist yet - you will implement it yourself!

That is, if you're attending a BDD/SpecFlow course.

## Agenda

### Get the code

You'll be working on a branch of the repository that has been set up for the
training. This allows you to catch up with the trainer's code throughout the day.

Substitute `THEBRANCH` below with what the trainer tells you.
It's usually today's date, followed by the trainer's initials: `YYYY-MM-DD-FL`.

Git:

    git clone https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.net.git
    cd shouty.net
    git checkout THEBRANCH
    
_You can also use the [GitHub extentsion for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.github.com/)._
